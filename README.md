# Themal

An interactive design system that lets you pick a brand color and watch every token update in real time. Export a CSS snapshot or open a PR to propose changes.

## How It Works

All palette colors are HSL custom properties on `:root`. From one brand color, the system derives a full token set (secondary, accent, muted, destructive) using your choice of color harmony scheme: complementary, triadic, analogous, split-complementary, or tetradic.  

Every foreground/background pair is audited against WCAG AA (4.5:1) via axe-core. Failing pairs are auto-corrected by adjusting foreground lightness. Your theme persists in localStorage across reloads.

## npm Package

The editor is published to npm as [`@theemel/editor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theemel/editor) and can be installed in any React app:

```bash
npm install @theemel/editor
```

```tsx
import { DesignSystemEditor } from "@theemel/editor";
import "@theemel/editor/style.css";

function App() {
  return <DesignSystemEditor />;
}
```

Requires `react` and `react-dom` v18+. Optionally install `axe-core` (accessibility auditing) and `lucide-react` (icon previews) for full functionality. See [`packages/editor/README.md`](packages/editor/README.md) for full API docs, props, and exported utilities.
