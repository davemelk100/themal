I recognized the need for a more sustainable and integrated approach, especially as I supported enterprise clients like Delta Dental of Michigan.\n\nI began by conducting usability evaluations and accessibility audits across several of their internal applications. Through screen reader testing, keyboard navigation reviews, and WCAG/Section 508 audits, I identified critical barriers to access, particularly in areas involving form-heavy workflows and administrative tools.\n\nRather than only reporting issues, I built an accessibility support model that included reusable code snippets (HTML, CSS, JS/TS), component-level guidelines, and Figma pattern documentation. I worked closely with developers and business analysts to bake accessibility into the design system and into Agile sprints, ensuring each scrum team had a shared understanding of what accessible implementation looked like.\n\nI formalized these practices into enterprise-wide standards, which included ADA, WCAG, and Section 508 compliance. I created internal documentation and training workshops to scale adoption. I also integrated storytelling techniques into design prototypes, helping stakeholders visualize the impact of inclusive design and making accessibility a shared responsibility across design, development, and QA.\n\nAs a result, we shifted from reactive compliance to proactive inclusion, setting a scalable precedent for accessible design that aligned with business goals and regulatory requirements.",

They aimed to include real-time language translation, customizable industry-specific vocabulary, and seamless integration with existing communication platforms. Their goal was to deliver a user-friendly and highly accurate solution that would increase adoption, address diverse client needs, and strengthen our competitive advantage.\n\nI led the UX effort, starting with user flows and wireframes, and continued by developing interactive prototypes to gather feedback from stakeholders and users. I then built a front-end prototype using React and TypeScript to demonstrate the user interface and highlight the potential of OpenAI integration.\n\nWe used Optimizely to run A/B tests and refine the design, collecting qualitative insights to ensure the interface was intuitive and the AI features were effective. I contributed from concept through production, with a focus on accessibility and scalability. The result was a seamless and impactful transcription tool that became a key business differentiator.",

I also surveyed team members to understand their career aspirations and areas where they wanted to grow.\n\nBased on my findings, I proposed several efficiency improvements including standardized design systems, automated testing protocols, and cross-functional training programs. I created detailed implementation plans that included timelines, resource requirements, and success metrics.\n\nI worked closely with leadership to gain buy-in and secure the necessary resources. I then led the implementation of these improvements, starting with the most impactful changes first. This included establishing a design system that reduced design-to-development handoff time by 40%, implementing automated testing that caught 60% more bugs before production, and creating mentorship programs that helped junior team members advance their careers.\n\nThe result was a more efficient, engaged team that delivered projects 25% faster while providing new growth opportunities for team members. Several team members were promoted to new roles, and the organization saw improved retention rates and higher job satisfaction scores.",

          "For a greenfield project, ideally, I'd like to be in the earliest stage (\"furthest left\") possible. This gives us a way to absorb the concept, understand the reasoning, and provide insight as to how the design plan should begin.\n\nIn no particular order, I would want to know these things first:\nAudience / Client?\nWhat is the business goal?\nExpectations for initial deliverables (paper? static? clickable prototype?)\nHow much budget/time for user research?\nAre we delivering an MVP or fully baked product?\nDo we have a color palette from Marketing or otherwise? Same for fonts?\nWhich views are top priority?\nAre we focusing on mobile-first? Which form factor(s) best suits our targeted users?\n\nAssuming we get those details, we (Product and Design) then sit with an SME or BA to dive deeper into the details to share and synthesize all user data we've collected. If we have no user data, we research the client/audience to determine the best way in which to obtain meaningful feedback. The mechanism used to find those folks and test with them will vary depending on what we are trying to find out. I could write much more, but suffice it to say, we decide which quantitative / qualitative / behavioral / ethnographic / et al data we need and what technique(s) helps us best retrieve it.\n\nDesigners begin the persona and user journey mapping exercises, while others are wireframing concurrently beginning with a general site 'frame' and using general best practices and minimal detail. This can be done in Figma or elsewhere – as long as we can easily share and present the details.\n\nAt this point, we have enough to start fleshing out full pages and implementing colors and branding. The sooner we get this in front of decision makers and obtain signoff on the core structure, the sooner we can start propagating the look-and-feel to the rest of the app.\n\nFirst, we can focus on our building blocks, which essentially means creating base components and their variants. We can also declare our variables at this point. As this work is happening, we need to collect graphic assets, whether they be stock images or original, and we need to start writing copy.\n\nIn the spirit of getting something in front of the client sooner rather than later, I'd put half the designers on fleshing out full-page layouts with placeholders for content within the sections. And I would put the other half on building out cards or section elements and microinteractions. This not only allows stakeholders to see *something* with a fully structured page, even if there are placeholders or bare bone designs that are indicative of purpose. A page with colors and tasteful placeholders goes a long way in earning trust that progress is indeed being made.\n\nFrom there, as the design nears completion, I would begin a conversation with engineering to ensure the images and details provide enough context for them. I also want to find out the technical feasibility, and the timeframe in which they feel this can be executed within. After those discussions occur, we define the scope of that function or feature based on input from business, product, and development stakeholders.\n\nBy now, we'd like to have all design elements locked down and assembled into a master design system. Once the design is built and deployed, it's open to (welcomed) scrutiny so we can find more granular details and user behaviors in addition to overarching feedback.\n\nBased on what we've learned, we synthesize the data, and perform this exercise again, but now, with considerable progress and much more data about users and feasibility.",

          "What started as a simple portfolio site evolved into a comprehensive career portal that demonstrates both technical skills and content management capabilities. The journey began with a basic React/TypeScript application showcasing design work and career history.\n\nThe initial challenge was creating a portfolio that could adapt to different audiences and purposes. Rather than building separate sites for different use cases, I designed a single application with sophisticated content management capabilities. This approach allowed the same codebase to serve as a portfolio, writing platform, and demonstration of technical skills.\n\nThe technical implementation focused on creating a flexible content system. I built a comprehensive admin panel with granular visibility controls for all content types - articles, design work, lab projects, and testimonials. The system includes persistent storage with export/import functionality, session management, and backup/restore capabilities.\n\nKey features include a music player showcasing creative interests, a writing gallery with card-based layout for content management, and sophisticated storage system with migration capabilities. The admin panel allows real-time content management without requiring code changes, making it easy to update the portfolio for different opportunities.\n\nThe result is a portfolio that serves multiple purposes: it demonstrates technical skills through its implementation, showcases design work through its presentation, and provides a platform for sharing insights through articles and writing samples. The content management system itself becomes a demonstration of understanding user needs and creating efficient workflows.\n\nThis approach has proven valuable for career opportunities where technical skills, design thinking, and content management abilities are all relevant. The portfolio demonstrates not just what I've done, but how I think about solving problems and creating systems that scale.",

        content: `<h1>MANIFEST Development (Yes, it's an acronym)</h1>

<h2>An artifact from a development approach I put together for building better software and, often more importantly, a better team.</h2>

<p>As a younger developer, I went to quite a few tech conferences and traveled considerably. I noticed a common theme in many of these talks and conference events, and the theme is still relevant today. Boiled down to its essence - developers want to do a good job, but they also want to innovate. And the two are obviously not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is the aforementioned 'manifesto':</p>

<h2><strong>MANIFEST Development</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>M</strong>ake<br>
<strong>A</strong>ll<br>
<strong>N</strong>ecessary<br>
<strong>I</strong>nteractions<br>
<strong>F</strong>easible,<br>
<strong>E</strong>xtendable,<br>
<strong>S</strong>ignificant,<br>
<strong>T</strong>ruthful</h3>

<p>This document is intended to make you a better developer, and also potentially a better human being altogether.</p>

<p>If you work in the software development field, we'll just go ahead and assume you have the technical chops required to retain a job in this industry. But as we all know, not all developers are created equal. Technical prowess aside, some developers simply 'get it' more than others. These folks are usually courteous, attentive to details, cooperative, patient and great decision makers. We've seen people who fail miserably at this part of their job. Great coder, terrible teammate.</p>

<p>They won't ever be the great developer that they see themselves as today. If they can't surpass their inability to cooperate effectively with others, they will remain stagnant within the self-imposed ceiling they'll continue to hit.</p>

<p>This manifesto contains small chunks of advice we believe - if followed - will set you apart from the rest of the industry. It will endear you not only to your peers but also to your partners in the business, and the management at large. But ultimately it will fulfill YOU most. You can become a respected member of the community simply by your actions, decisions and ability to communicate effectively.</p>

<h2><strong>Technology Agnosticism</strong></h2>

<p>Balance open-mindedness with healthy skepticism. Trends in this field fade quickly.<br>
There isn't always a clear way to select a technology. The newest, shiniest product/framework/design pattern/methodology, etc. is not necessarily the right tool for the job. Or for your team. Or for your project. Or based upon the constraints within your infrastructure. Try them all, evaluate without emotion or bias, then make a choice based on which approach satisfies each one of your requirements.</p>

<h3><strong>Scalable Methods Of Practice</strong></h3>

<p>Treat the way you learn like the way you code. Build your knowledge based on not only the hands-on necessities to get code up and running, but also using high-level conceptual learning techniques. Be able to analyze the tool you have chosen or not only syntax, but for the overall methodology it employs. Have you seen this pattern before? Does it use best practice for all involved parties? This not only helps you understand this specific technology, but makes you better at choosing technologies in the future.</p>

<h3><strong>Patience In Decision</strong></h3>

<p>Be patient. In doing so, you will absolutely make better decisions. Don't mistake hastiness for a sense of urgency.</p>

<h2><strong>Quality-Focus</strong></h2>

<p>Don't hurry up to satisfy unrealistic deadlines. Plead your case to the teams to insist on producing the right measure of quality for all code you commit and deploy.</p>

<h3><strong>Testing and Diagnosis</strong></h3>

<p>Before you code, nail down what you will use to test. This includes tools, test cases, etc. This isn't optional. Test everything, everywhere. This will make you a better developer, guaranteed.</p>

<p>The most successful developers are often the ones who are able to diagnose code well. We aren't always able to start with a codebase we approve of and we almost always inherit code we would have done differently. Regardless, your ability to use skills and tools that aid you in diagnosing code will prove major dividends to you as not only a defect resolver, but as a reverse engineer when a situation calls for it.</p>

<h3><strong>Commitment To Process</strong></h3>

<p>Process does not exist to make your life more difficult. Process exists to ensure consistent, repeatable tasks get done as efficiently and effectively as necessary without having to improvise a new solution each time you conduct the same task. Process is the business equivalent to programming.</p>

<p>At a conference, I learned that at Etsy, they make each new developer change code and then deploy it to production as an exercise in testing their process. If the new developer fails at this, then Etsy concludes that their process isn't robust enough.</p>

<h2><strong>Perpetual Innovation</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Fearless Coding</strong></h3>

<p>Do not be afraid. When you open your code editor, get ready to break rules and break functionality. The only way to get better is to break down, re-examine and re-build. Don't worry about status quo. Deadlines always need to be met, but don't sell yourself short on the amount of reckless productivity you can generate by being inquisitive, curious and intent on finding a better way.</p>

<h3><strong>Focus On The Next</strong></h3>

<p>Be the razor that cuts the bleeding edge. Define the bleeding edge. Don't sit around reading about people who theorize it. Do it. Make it. Stop sitting there and innovate.</p>

<h3><strong>Create The Future</strong></h3>

<p>The future has zero blueprints. Nobody can predict what is going to happen. It is incumbent upon you to thrust features and technology into people's lives that will inspire them about what is to come. We are today's manufacturing class. We create experiences and tools that help people live better lives.</p>

<h2><strong>Cooperation-Centric</strong></h2>

<p>I've seen many a developer meet failure because of a lack of ability to get along with partners on a project. There's no way you can bulldoze your ideas and opinions through a team of your peers and expect to succeed.</p>

<h3><strong>Constraint Cognizance</strong></h3>

<p>You will never have a job that doesn't have constraints. Resist every urge you have to complain about it. Read "The Obstacle Is The Way" by Ryan Holiday. He has great advice about re-envisioning your struggles and how to use them to your advantage.</p>

<h3><strong>Comfort Zone Re-Zoning</strong></h3>

<p>As uncomfortable as it is for many of us, you must speak to actual people, preferably in a conversational construct. We all probably enjoy this least, but this is what may ultimately serve you best.</p>

<p>Take a fresh approach to interacting with your peers and business partners. Concede that you are going to be more successful by discussing and learning about this project by having a better relationship with these folks. This is exactly how you get better at your job. You can't live your whole life under the headphones and in a bubble.</p>`,

        url: "live-design-system",
        content: `<h1>A Design System That Designs Itself</h1>

<p>Design systems are documentation that nobody reads. They're Figma files that drift out of sync the moment a developer touches real code. They're PDFs that get emailed around, printed out, pinned to walls, and promptly ignored.</p>

<p>So I built one that's alive.</p>

<p>On my portfolio site, there's a design system section where you can pick any brand color you want. Any color. The system then derives an entire palette from that single choice - secondary, accent, background, foreground, destructive, success, warning - all of it. In real time. On the actual live site. Not a mockup. Not a prototype. The real thing.</p>

<h2>The Problem With Static Systems</h2>

<p>We've spent years building elaborate design systems. Tokens, variables, semantic naming conventions. We write documentation explaining that <code>--brand</code> should maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against <code>--background</code>. We create Figma libraries with auto-layout and variant components. We hold meetings about the meetings we need to schedule about color governance.</p>

<p>And then somebody changes a hex value in a CSS file and the whole thing collapses like a house of cards in a wind tunnel.</p>

<p>The fundamental issue isn't discipline or process. It's that static documentation can't enforce its own rules. A PDF that says "maintain WCAG AA contrast" has no mechanism to actually do that. It's a suggestion masquerading as a system.</p>

<h2>Let The Machine Do The Math</h2>

<p>The live design system runs accessibility audits after every color change. It uses axe-core to check contrast ratios in real time, then automatically adjusts colors to meet WCAG AA standards. You pick a brand color that violates contrast requirements? The system fixes it. Quietly. Immediately. No committee meeting required.</p>

<p>It doesn't just check and complain. It learns. The system remembers which corrections work for which hue and lightness ranges. Similar colors in the future get corrected proactively, before the violation even occurs. It's building its own institutional knowledge, which is more than I can say for most organizations I've worked with.</p>

<h2>Harmony Without The Theory Degree</h2>

<p>There's a Variations dropdown with four harmony schemes: complementary, analogous, triadic, and split-complementary. These aren't random words from a design textbook that someone memorized for a job interview. They're mathematical relationships between hues on the color wheel.</p>

<p>Pick "triadic" and the system rotates your brand hue by 120 and 240 degrees to derive secondary and accent colors. Pick "analogous" and it shifts 30 degrees in each direction. The math is old. The color wheel hasn't changed since Newton. But now you don't need to know any of it. You click a button, and the system handles the theory.</p>

<p>Hit Refresh and get a completely new random palette. Don't like it? Undo. Try another. The cost of experimentation is zero, which means people actually experiment.</p>

<h2>From Pixels to Pull Requests</h2>

<p>Here's where it gets interesting. Once you've built a palette you like, you can export the CSS variables or generate a Tailwind config snippet. One click, clipboard. But that's table stakes.</p>

<p>The "Open PR" button sends your custom theme to a serverless function that creates a pull request directly on the GitHub repository. From the browser. No Git knowledge required. No terminal. No merge conflicts. A designer - or anyone with an opinion about color - can propose changes to the actual codebase without ever leaving the site.</p>

<p>We've spent a decade talking about bridging the gap between design and development. Turns out the bridge is just a button.</p>

<h2>Same Problems, Different Instruments</h2>

<p>None of this is conceptually new. Color theory is centuries old. Accessibility standards have been around for decades. Design systems have existed since the first brand guidelines were printed on paper. We're still solving the same problems: consistency, accessibility, collaboration.</p>

<p>What's changed is the tooling. CSS custom properties let us swap entire palettes at runtime. Contrast ratio math runs in milliseconds. Serverless functions handle the plumbing between a browser and a Git repository. The individual pieces are all well-established. The interesting part is wiring them together into something that actually works without human intervention.</p>

<p>The system enforces its own rules. It corrects its own mistakes. It learns from its own corrections. It turns design decisions into code contributions without a handoff meeting, a Jira ticket, or a Slack thread with 47 emoji reactions.</p>

<h2>Less Typing, More Thinking</h2>

<p>The real value isn't the technology. It's the time it gives back. When you don't have to manually check contrast ratios, manually derive palette variations, manually translate design tokens into code - you can spend that time on the things that actually require a human brain. Layout decisions. Content hierarchy. Whether that interaction pattern actually makes sense for your users.</p>

<p>The machine handles the math. The machine enforces the rules. The machine remembers what worked before. And we get to keep our hands clean and our brains busy with the work that matters.</p>

<p>That's the whole point. Not to replace the designer. To remove the tedium so the designer can actually design.</p>

        content: `<h1>I Heard About Using JSON for AI Prompts, and Now I'm Obsessed</h1>

<h2>The Discovery</h2>

<p>I was scrolling through a post when someone mentioned they were using JSON to structure their AI prompts. My first reaction was "wow, yes!". Soon after, I was absolutely furious that I hadn't thought of it first. And then I thought 'omg am I the only one who hasn't heard of this? Was I was wrong to be furious? Of course - I want to be the first to know about everything.'</p>

<p>That said, it's a simplisticly elegant and brilliant idea that is sitting right in front of my face.</p>

<p>See, me, I like to brain dump into that input box with little to no regard for spelling and punctuation. Now, instead of relying on my horribly-structured and poorly-punctuated typing, I copy my lazy prompt, then paste it into an LLM, and say 'make this JSON'. The resulting JSON proceeds to organize my pile of text into a cohesive structure.</p>

<h2>Why JSON Makes Sense</h2>

<p>Ask an AI to "create a login form," you're leaving a lot to interpretation. What validation rules should it include? What styling should it use? Should it have password requirements? What about error handling? You get my drift</p>

<p>But when you structure that same request as JSON, you can be explicit about every detail:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "request": "create_login_form",
  "requirements": {
    "validation": ["email_format", "password_strength"],
    "styling": "modern_minimal",
    "error_handling": "user_friendly",
    "accessibility": "wcag_aa_compliant"
  },
  "constraints": {
    "framework": "react",
    "styling": "tailwind_css"
  }
}</code></pre>

<h3>Breaking Down the Structure:</h3>

<h4>📋 Request Section</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Defines what you want the AI to create</p>
<pre><code>"request": "create_login_form"</code></pre>

<h4>✅ Requirements Section</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Specifies the features and behaviors you need</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>validation:</strong> What input validation rules to include</li>
<li><strong>styling:</strong> The visual design approach</li>
<li><strong>error_handling:</strong> How to handle and display errors</li>
<li><strong>accessibility:</strong> Compliance standards to follow</li>
</ul>

<h4>🔧 Constraints Section</h4>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Defines technical limitations and preferences</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>framework:</strong> Which technology stack to use</li>
<li><strong>styling:</strong> Specific CSS framework or approach</li>
</ul>

<p>Suddenly, there's no ambiguity. Mr. LLM Search Engine knows exactly what you want, and you get more predictable outcomes.</p>

<p>Basically, just pick one common task you do and create a JSON structure for it. Maybe it's generating React components, or writing API documentation, or creating test cases. But I don't need to tell you that. You're smart. Do whatever you want with it. But you have to admit, it's kinda awesome. I'm very glad that I thought of it first. What?</p>

          "Make an agreement on shared language with the fountain of eternal hallucination, aka your AI co-pilot.",
        url: "https://davemelk.substack.com/p/negotiating-with-your-co-pilot",
        content: `<h1>Negotiating With Your Co-Pilot</h1>

<h2>The Language Barrier</h2>

<p>Working with AI is like having a brilliant but sometimes confused co-worker who speaks a different dialect. You might both be speaking English, but you're using different words for the same things. This creates a communication gap that leads to misunderstandings, wasted time, and yes, those infamous AI hallucinations.</p>

<p>The solution isn't to dumb down your requests or accept mediocre results. It's to establish a shared vocabulary - a common language that both you and your AI co-pilot understand clearly.</p>

<h2>Why Shared Language Matters</h2>

<p>When you say "card" and your AI thinks you mean "content container with defined boundaries, shadows, and padding," you're setting yourself up for confusion. But when you both agree that a card is a "card," communication becomes crystal clear.</p>

<p>This isn't just about avoiding misunderstandings. Shared language creates efficiency. You spend less time explaining what you want and more time getting what you need. Your AI co-pilot becomes more predictable, more reliable, and more useful.</p>

<h2>Creating Your Shared Vocabulary</h2>

<p>Start by documenting the terms you use for common elements. In your design system, you have cards, buttons, modals, sections, and more. These aren't just UI components - they're the building blocks of your shared language.</p>

<p>Create a glossary that both you and your AI can reference. When you say "add a card here," your AI should know exactly what that means. No more guessing games or interpretation errors.</p>

<h2>The Hallucination Prevention Protocol</h2>

<p>AI hallucinations often happen when there's ambiguity in language. When you're vague about what you want, the AI fills in the gaps with assumptions. Sometimes these assumptions are helpful, but often they're wrong.</p>

<p>By establishing clear, shared terminology, you reduce the room for interpretation. A button is a button, not a "clickable element that triggers an action." A modal is a modal, not an "overlay dialog that appears above the main content."</p>

<h2>Negotiating the Terms</h2>

<p>This is a two-way conversation. Your AI might suggest alternative terms that are more precise or more commonly understood. Be open to these suggestions, but also be clear about your preferences.</p>

<p>If you've always called something a "card," there's no need to change that just because your AI suggests "content container." But if your AI points out that "modal" is more specific than "popup," that might be worth considering.</p>

<h2>Testing Your Shared Language</h2>

<p>Once you've established your vocabulary, test it. Ask your AI to create a card, then ask it to create a content container. If you get different results, you know your language isn't aligned yet.</p>

<p>Keep refining until you're both speaking the same language. This might take a few iterations, but the payoff is worth it.</p>

<h2>The Long-Term Benefits</h2>

<p>With shared language comes better collaboration. Your AI becomes more like a true co-pilot - someone who understands your workflow, your preferences, and your terminology.</p>

<p>You'll spend less time explaining and more time creating. Your AI will generate more accurate, more useful results. And most importantly, you'll reduce the frustration that comes from miscommunication.</p>

<h2>Making the Agreement</h2>

<p>So here's the deal: establish your shared vocabulary, document it clearly, and stick to it. Use the same terms consistently in your requests, and expect your AI to understand them.</p>

<p>This isn't about limiting creativity or flexibility. It's about creating a foundation for better collaboration. When you and your AI co-pilot speak the same language, you can focus on the important stuff - building great experiences for your users.</p>

<p>Remember, this is a negotiation, not a dictatorship. Be clear about your needs, listen to your AI's suggestions, and find common ground. The result will be a more productive, more enjoyable partnership with your digital co-pilot.</p>`,

    specsContent: `The live design system on this site is built around CSS custom properties (design tokens) defined on :root. Every color in the palette is stored in HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), which makes algorithmic manipulation straightforward — shifting a hue by 180° gives you a complementary color; splitting by ±150° gives you a split-complementary scheme, and so on.

When you pick a brand color, the system derives the full token set using one of several harmony schemes: complementary, triadic, analogous, split-complementary, or tetradic. Each scheme applies a different set of hue offsets to generate secondary, accent, muted, and destructive palette roles from a single base hue.

After palette generation, every foreground/background pair is audited against WCAG AA contrast requirements in real time. The system uses axe-core to run a full accessibility audit, then automatically corrects any pair that falls below the 4.5:1 contrast ratio threshold. Correction works by adjusting the foreground's lightness value — nudging it lighter or darker until the ratio passes. A knowledge base records these corrections so the same fix is applied instantly on subsequent visits, avoiding a redundant audit cycle.

Your theme state — the full set of custom-property values — is persisted in localStorage. Reload the page, navigate away and come back, and your customized palette is still there. You can also generate a CSS snapshot of your current theme, or open a pull request to propose your theme changes directly to the repository.`,
