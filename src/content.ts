From one brand color the system derives the full token set (secondary, accent, muted, destructive) using your choice of harmony scheme: complementary, triadic, analogous, split-complementary, or tetradic.

Every foreground/background pair is audited against WCAG AA (4.5:1) via axe-core. Failing pairs are auto-corrected by adjusting foreground lightness, and fixes are cached so subsequent visits skip the redundant audit. Your theme persists in localStorage across reloads.`,
