    transcript: `"I knew him as a kid, not through school, but because my sister rented a house across the street from him. We spent a lot of time together back then. Jack was on a different wavelength—his mind worked in ways mine didn't.

He went on to better himself, while I just hung back with the crowd. But Jack was an incredible kid, truly special. I know a lot of bad things have been said about him, but his drive came from a deeply personal place. His mother was dying of cancer, in constant agony. That pain shaped him. As a young teen, he decided that if he could find a way to spare people that kind of suffering in their final days, he would. That's what drove him to develop his methods, like the pain-relieving concoction he put together for Tracy, who was in excruciating pain on a hospital bed. They'd prop her up, and she'd still have to wait 30 minutes for a shot. Can you imagine that?

Today, we have pain pumps and medications like morphine to manage suffering, but Jack questioned why anyone would want to get people hooked on morphine when there were other ways. He was determined to ease the excruciating pain of those final days. His mom passed when he was in his early teens, and that experience left a mark on him. It's why he got so much bad press—people misunderstood him. If you didn't know his story, you might think he was some kind of monster, but that wasn't Jack. We were kids together, and I saw him grow up with this purpose.

I don't recall him living with us for six months, like Grandpa might've said, but our paths did cross a lot back then. By junior high, I was focused on becoming a vocational student, tinkering with aircraft mechanics, while Jack was in college prep, using his brain in the main school building. We rarely saw each other in high school because we were in different worlds. Later, though, I ran into him in Royal Oak. He was living in an apartment above a store, across from a funeral home. I was at a visitation for a mutual friend, walking down the hallway, when I heard someone call out. I turned around, and there was Jack—he recognized me from behind, after all those years. That's the kind of guy he was, extraordinary in every way.

I never liked getting into debates about him. Once, at church of all places, someone asked me what I thought about Jack. I said, "He's a physician doing what he thinks is right." The guy got upset, saying, "He's killing people!" I just shook my head. Killing people? No, he was trying to relieve them from a horrible death. I learned to avoid those discussions. The less people knew about my connection to Jack, the better—for both of us."`,

    transcript: `"One day, Jack came up to me, and I said something like, "Hey, Jack, would you sign my yearbook?" He flipped it open to an empty page, nothing on it, and asked, "Mind if I use this?" I said, "No, go ahead, Jack," never expecting what came next. He pulled out an ink pen—not a ballpoint, but a real ink pen with green ink.

I was probably chatting with someone else while Jack was over there, scribbling away. He finished, handed the yearbook back to me, and I didn't even look at it right away. I just hoped the ink was dry before he closed it. I think it was.

Later, when I saw it, I was amazed. In just a minute and a half, he'd filled the entire page with this incredible cartoon. Jack was truly an amazing guy, so talented. It's a shame he's often misunderstood, only showing up in comedians' punchlines or negative stories."`,

    transcript: `"I'm seeing a doctor soon to get my ears cleaned out—something about a vacuum for the wax buildup. I've been faking my way through conversations pretty well today, haven't I? It's not about loudness or tone; I don't need anyone shouting at me. I know I've got a hearing problem, but it's a long story. The short version? One ear's pretty much gone because of a hole in it.

You remember me mentioning that, right? I manage okay with the other ear, so I'll leave it at that. Oh, and how old am I now? Ninety-seven. At my age, a hearing problem's something I'm entitled to, don't you think? If that's my only issue, I'll wear it proudly.

Speaking of stories, we were laughing about how I got this house. Virginia took charge of finding us a new place. Back then, we were living in this tiny apartment—so small you had to step outside to change your mind. It was time to move. We ended up in Marshall, in a house next to where I grew up. The guy downstairs rented out the upstairs, and that's where we settled. It was a good move, no question."`,

    duration: "3:20",
    transcript: `"I guess they have the right to do that. They gave me one last chance to say goodbye to the old hearing aids or whatever. It's like a routine joke with them—dropped it right in my lap. Can you believe it? They even said I looked older with my new haircut.

By the way, if you hear me saying "huh?" a lot, it's because I don't have my hearing aids in. They're the cheap $1.98 ones, not the fancy kind. Last time we talked, I said I was happy with them, and I am. The others they tried to sell me before were ridiculous—$8,000! I got a refund on those. The $1.98 ones work just fine, believe it or not.

When I decided I didn't want the expensive ones, it was a hassle. They were the kind that rest behind your ear, and they drove me nuts. I told them, "No way, I'm done with these." When I returned them, it turned out the physician assistant who did my exam was the son of a lady who works with Todd. Small world, right? So, when they processed the refund, they wrote something like, "Patient is a good friend of the Evans family." No questions asked, just like that. Worked out great for me.

As for the cheap ones, they're sitting on the counter, charging right now. They're doing a heck of a job for what they cost. The only reason I'm not wearing them today is because I've got a wax buildup. I've got an appointment this Friday to get it checked out. Even with the hearing aids in, it's not helping much until that's cleared up."`,

    transcript: `"I have some old photos of the place we lived in back then. The outside wasn't finished yet—it wasn't rough, but it was still a work in progress. When I look at those pictures now, I think, "Who would've thought?" That's a great story, man. I hadn't heard that one before, and it's one of those moments that just sticks with you.

Virginia and I were living in this tiny apartment—so small you had to step outside to change your mind. I mean, it was that small. You've probably heard me use that line before, and I'll probably use it again. It's a good one, but it's gonna get worn out now.

Before we built our house, we moved into Elizabeth Lake Estates, just up the street from where you were on Avery. We bought a place there, and the best part was being right in the neighborhood with friends. It was a sweet deal. We were happy, no kids yet, so everything was coming up roses. You could even stay inside to change your mind there.

We had access to that fabulous beach, too. Back then, it wasn't as crowded as it is now. I was working a job with day and night shifts, so on night shifts, we'd head to the lake, and it'd be deserted. Can you imagine that now? These days, the beach is a zoo—probably like a boxing match or some kind of madness. Back then, we had that big metal slide and a little swing set, and that was enough. The place was always well-kept, not like today with all the traffic and trash that comes with it. It just gets a bit yucky now.

I hate change, don't we all? But Virginia had this itch to move. It wasn't that we didn't like Elizabeth Lake Estates; she just wanted something new. And me? I've got that ring in my nose—she tugs the chain, and I'm out the door. She did a hell of a job picking our next spot, though. No regrets there. We moved, and as they say, the rest is history.

We moved into our current place in '61, the same year they finished building it. I was 11 years old, for crying out loud. I remember seeing you at Food Town back then. That place predates everything. I was a grocery maven, no question. My best friend ended up marrying Mrs. Adler, who worked there—she was one of the Adlers, you know, the family behind Food Town. Her husband was a butcher, and they had a great, happy marriage. Even after he passed, she stayed close with her son, a real wheeler-dealer in the Clarkston area. The Adlers and Roths were the ones who developed Clarkston. In fact, Roth is our landlord at the store."`,

    transcript: `"I had the chance to take piano lessons when I was younger. The teacher would come to the house, take each of my fingers, and move them around—some kind of warm-up, I guess. But honestly, I was more interested in being outside playing ball. My brother was the musical one; he got really good at percussion. I love music, but I never learned to play it. That's about the extent of my musical talent.

When it came to singing, though, I found my place in a barbershop quartet. I sang bass. That's the only thing I ever accomplished musically, but we were pretty good. Jack Tuber was in the group too, and we had a blast. Those four-part harmonies were something special—close, tight, and beautiful. Nobody does that kind of harmony anymore, you know? It's a lost art."`,

It's a riot talking to him and uh of course his daughter is involved in the business theory, but yeah, Adler and Roth were a partners in developing. It's amazing all development that happened in Clarkston, yeah.  

I had a very good friend who has since passed, who lived where the control was for the damn.. Right there in downtown Clark? right and that's right across the street from there office. right.  He was bellyaging about that the last time I saw him is he had tried to figure out what to do to keep that thing under control. Well, and he didn't do a good job. still money. Oh, he had nice a nice thing to say about him because at the level would change automatically. and he said, you know, he doesn't do a good job with that damn with that damn damn.  

So, yeah, it was it's been an interesting uh interesting life, but he he was not happy with uh well, even though he's passed, believe me when I take, he'd still be unhappy about it. Bob Roth can't figure out what the hell he do to get that thing is they were they never changed. and folks. reason that damn that damn damnn is a problem. It really is they just they can't make hazard tails out of what to do because this thing under it is it is probably because of the way it was originally designed.  

And if you want to get into it now, the cost would be ast builder fee the licensing card to twel00 to get a building license or surprising he's connected but he could probably get around that but"`,
